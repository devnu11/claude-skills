# Architect: Current context and conventions

**Last updated:** 2026-10-10 (s8 done)

## Key design decisions

**Clean halt on limits, crashes, SIGTERM (s8):** Data-driven halt handling via `HALTS` table (kind → status, note_kind, exit_code, advice) and `LIMIT_PATTERNS` table (regex, template). `classify()` returns the detected halt; first halt wins in a process. Partial edits left uncommitted so human can see what was in progress. Exit codes: 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL limit), 70 (EX_SOFTWARE crash), 143 (SIGTERM). s9 will save interrupted step edits as a commit; s10 will record partial cost. ADR-0007 documents the strategy.

**Dashboard live UI (s5):** Vanilla JS with EventSource for live updates, Mermaid 11.4.1 flowchart from CDN (lazy-loaded), CSS tokens for themes, defensive rendering with per-row error handling. Five ADRs (0002–0006) document the choices. This completes the frontend half of the dashboard; s4 provides the backend (snapshot, SSE server, CLI). Known gaps: no executable test for animated features (verified by hand in headless Chrome); follow-up story recommended.

**Backlog and sprint membership (s3):** Stories default to the backlog and move to sprints via `start_sprint(goal, stories)`. This enforces the gate: backlog stories cannot proceed past their opener step. Legacy state.json files load with stories in the backlog automatically.

**Nested forbidden roots for Proxy (s7):** The sandbox computes the deepest literal path segment before wildcards (e.g., `agile-team/runner/agile_team/**` → `agile-team/runner/agile_team`, not just `agile-team`). This allows customer docs in `agile-team/docs/customer/` to coexist with source at `agile-team/runner/agile_team/`.

**Deny on any view (s7):** Proxy Bash checks run in two views (shell continuations and comment-aware). Over-deny is the strategy: a denial in any view blocks the command. This prevents false negatives at the cost of rare false positives (quoted comments).

## What you own

Review whether step sequences, gate checks, and role boundaries remain sound. The Unit Tester and Integration Tester are critical checkpoints; ensure they have clear design context in handoffs. s8 introduces `halt_run()` as a new entrypoint for both role-step limits (dispatch) and top-level exceptions (cli); verify the boundary is clean.

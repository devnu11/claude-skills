# Developer (CLI): Current context and conventions

**Last updated:** 2026-10-10 (s8 done)

See `developer.md` for the base conventions.

## CLI-specific context

**Clean halt on limits, crashes, SIGTERM (s8):** New modules and changes:
- `halt.py`: exception → `Halt` (kind, reason); `HALTS` and `LIMIT_PATTERNS` tables; `classify()` detector chain
- `dispatch.Runtime.halt_run()`: records first halt, saves status+reason, posts note
- `dispatch._step_failed()`: catches role-step exceptions, classifies limit vs. other errors
- `cli._halt_exit()`, `cli._finish()`: top-level halt handling
- `po_tools.PoRun._settle()`: skips settle when `runtime.halted_by` is set
- Partial edits after a halt are left uncommitted for the human and s9
- s9 will save interrupted step edits; s10 will record partial cost. This story only stops cleanly.
- See ADR-0007 for the data-driven strategy.

**Nested sandbox roots (s7):** The Customer Proxy reads customer docs and uses the installed CLI. Ensure CLI help and examples don't reference source code paths. Keep documentation output friendly to restricted sandboxes.

**Bash enforcement (s7):** Design CLI output and examples to avoid quoted comments or ambiguous shell constructs. The Proxy's check is conservative; when it blocks a legitimate command, refactor the example or workflow.
